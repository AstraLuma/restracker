\item Student users can edit the reservations for the events they create.
\item Group users can view events, rooms, equipment, clubs, reservations, comments, and users.
\item Group users can edit events they sponsor.
\item Group users can edit the reservations for the events they sponsor.
\item Group users can comment on events and comments.

\item Super Administrator users can perform any action Administrators can.
\item Super Administrator users can view, add, update and delete: rooms, events, equipment, users, reservations and comments.
\item Users shall be able to search for a room.
\item Users shall be able to get a list of what rooms a group has
reserved and when they are reserved for.
\item Administrators shall be able to view recent changes to the database.
\item An administrator must approve a reservation before it is official.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item room -includes equipment
%\item equipment - includes rooms in
%\item clubs -include events sponsored 
%\item events -include comments, equipment used
%\item users -include events they're in charge of
%\item reservation 
%\end{itemize}

%available times
%overlapping reservations - including events
%search for rooms based on date/time
%search for rooms based on equipment
%search for rooms based on occupancy range (or just minimum occupancy)

%statistic pages:
	%most used rooms

\section{Queries}
\subsection{Retrival}

The following items can be queried on for either an identifying list of items,
or for a detailed list of the information and relations in the database about each item:
\begin{itemize}
\item room - includes equipment
\item equipment - includes rooms in
\item clubs - include events sponsored 
\item events - include comments, equipment used
\item users - include events they're in charge of
\item reservation 
\end{itemize}

Rooms can be queried based on available times such that only rooms with no approved reservations at those times are returned.
If there are unapproved reservations for that room at that time that is also returned.

Rooms can be queried based on the presence of specific equipment in them.

Rooms can be queried based on occupancy range (or just minimum occupancy).

Reservations can be queried such that all overlapping reservations are returned along with their events.

A user can request statistic pages from the database. These include statistics on:
\begin{itemize}
\item most commonly used rooms
\item favorite events based on rating of comments about the event
\item which student majors run the most events
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Updates}
The following operations are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a user
\item Change user information
\item Turn a user into a student, administrator, or a club
\item Make an administrator super
\item Add student to a club
\item Comment on an event
\item Create an event
\item Add, change, and remove equipment in a room
\item Add, change, and remove equipment used by an event
\item Add and remove a reservation
\item Approve a reservation
\item Remove approval of a reservation
\item Add and remove clubs to events
\item Create a room
\item Change room information
\item Create and update sessions
\item Clean old sessions
\item Super Administrators (presumably skilled users) may run additional queries via direct database access
\end{itemize}

\section{SQL queries}
\subsection{Retrevial}
\verbatiminput{queries.txt}

\subsection{Updates}
\verbatiminput{updates.txt}

\section{Logs}
\subsection{Retrevial}
We run:
\verbatiminput{queries.sql} 
into psql and the output is:
\verbatiminput{phase3-log.txt}

\section{Application Layer Decisions}
Python is the language being used to implement the front end of the system. Jamie is familiar with this language
and it is known to be easy to implement web interfaces with it. Jamie has provided Sam and Stephanie with code examples
to help gain familiarity with the language.

PostgresSQL is being used for the database because it is free, like MySQL, but has many advanced features, like ORACLE,
including foreign key checking.

The basic interface opens with a list of upcoming events. From there users can log in and once they have done so they are presented
with links to pages that allow them to query and update the database as is appropriate to their user type. Items related to them,
such as events they are running or need to approve, are also presented on log in.


\section{Advanced Features}
There are a few advanced features that if implemented would be a boon to the system. The use or triggers to detect
when a new reservation conflicts with a previous one and mark them would allow users to tell immediately when there
might be a scheduling problem. It is possible the system may even want to index reservations that conflict with others
as these will be looked at frequently, at least as long as they exist, so that the conflict may be analyzed and resolved.
Triggers could also be used to check database consistency when information is added or removed.


\section{Division of Labor}
The project team met 3 times for various lengths of time for this project phase. Most work was done collaboratively,
however the majority of the work on each section is as follows:

Sam:
\begin{itemize}
\item Updating requirements to include different users and how they can use the system.
\item Writing retrieval queries in English.
\item Writing update queries in English.
\item Writing on the use of advanced features like triggers and indexing.
\item Write up of technologies used.
\end{itemize}

Stephanie:
\begin{itemize}
\item Writing retrieval and update queries in SQL.
\item Writing initial test data.
\end{itemize}

Jamie:
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing and updating the database, including addition of more data and running queries.
\item Work on preparing the database and front end for future phases.
\end{itemize}
