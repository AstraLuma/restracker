\section{}
Our ER model was created in an iterative process and ran by the TA before
the submission of phase 1. The TA had no further comments on our phase 1
submission.

Having analyzed every non-key attribute in every table, we realized that no
other attribute is implied by it. This means normalization isn't possible. 

Some things we questioned as to whether or not there were functional
dependences. These were the title and privaledges of an admin, and the title and
description of an event. Because titles are something defined by the
administration, and may not directly relate to how the user uses the system, we
felt there wasn't a functional dependency. In the case of event name and
description, weekly events may have the same name and different descriptions
dependent on what will be going on that week.

\marginpar{In the submitted online version there are some mistakes in the DDL
statements. I had accidentally checked out from the repository before the fixed
version was committed and did not notice the file I included was not the one
without mistakes.}

\section{}
This past week we met Thursday after class to discuss what we were doing, on
Sunday, and on Wedensday. We are contining to meet on Wedensday to work, when
the phase is first assigned to discuss our plan, and once other, though that
meeting is dependent on our schedules. We also distribute our work over git,
though we meet in person.

\marginpar{In our online submission Jamie was said to have handled loading the
data. The data had not been loaded last night and this was not his fault.
Stephanie had taken over this with the extended deadline, but did not get it
done because of health reasons. }
Like our previous phase, our work was mainly joint. All work was done while we
were in meetings. However, certain parts were mostly done by specific people.
Sam wrote up the english description of the tables of the database. Stephanie
wrote up the ddl statements. Jamie handled configuring the database, testing and
fixing the ddl statements.
